# Task 3: Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)
**Intern Name:** Melvin Fadil PK
**Date:** January 19, 2026

## 📄 Project Description
This repository contains the analysis of network traffic using **Wireshark**. I captured and analyzed TCP handshakes, DNS queries, and evaluated the security differences between HTTP and HTTPS.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **TCP Analysis:** Captured the 3-Way Handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
2. **DNS Analysis:** Inspected DNS queries resolving domain names to IP addresses.
3. **Security Check:** Verified that HTTPS traffic is encrypted (TLS) while HTTP is plain text.
4. **Packet Capture:** Saved the raw traffic data for analysis.

## 📂 Files Included
* `Task3_Report.pdf` - The detailed analysis with screenshots.
* `traffic_capture.pcapng` - The raw Wireshark capture file.
